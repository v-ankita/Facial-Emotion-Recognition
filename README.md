# Facial-Emotion-Recognition


### Problem statement -
Facial expression recognition is an intuitive reflection of a person's mental state, which contains rich emotional information. Using Deep Learning, facial emotion recognition (FER) can be implemented for analysing sentiments. The task here is to take the image of a face as input and classify it as accurately as possible into the correct emotion category it belongs to. A set of 7 standard emotions will be considered

### Metadata -
Dataset - FER-2013
- The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces.
- There are a total of 35,887 examples
- The facial expression is classified into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral).

### Methodology - 

After performing Expolarory Data Analysis, reading research papers on the problem and defining a pre-processing pipeline, 4 models were successfully implemented.
1. CNN-1
2. CNN-2
3. Xception model
4. VGGFace model

### Analysis and Inference - 
In depth analysis of the results and conclusion can be found in file Result_Analysis.md
